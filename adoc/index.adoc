*Please feel free to correct or help me with anything in this documentation.*

This is not official documentation. I am still currently and will continue to attempt to get vulkan to work cleanly with the sub-part of the DRM subsytem called KMS.
I initially started thinking of how I wanted to implement lucurious as of February 2019. I was watching the t.v series The Expanse and was looking at how
awesome the user interfaces looked. After thinking I realized that Iâ€™ve seen this done before in video games and in web browsers.

So, what is lucurious? It is an *easy to use* library for building highly sophisticated and advanced Vulkan DRM renderers. These renderers allow for easy
creation of interactable single application compositors that appear to be straight out of science fiction.
