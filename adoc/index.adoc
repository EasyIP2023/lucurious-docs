*Please feel free to correct or help me with anything in this documentation.*

This is not official documentation. I am still currently and will continue to attempt to get vulkan to work cleanly with the sub-part of the DRM subsytem called KMS.
I initially started thinking of how I wanted to implement lucurious as of February 2019. I was watching the t.v series The Expanse and was looking at how
awesome the user interfaces looked. After thinking I realized that Iâ€™ve seen this done before in video games and in web browsers.

So, what is lucurious? It is an *easy to use* library for building highly sophisticated and advanced Vulkan DRM renderers. These renderers allow for easy
creation of interactable single application compositors that appear to be straight out of science fiction. This API is meant to very tightly coupled. When I was
first building it, I figured it would make it easier to keep track of FD's and vulkan handles.
