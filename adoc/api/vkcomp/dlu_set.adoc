== dlu_set_*(3)

== BRIEF DESCRIPTION

Most **dlu_set**_* functions are just wrappers around Vulkan structures. Thus, can be ignored and not utilized. I added them to limit
the amount of lines of C code one has to write. Whenever the keyword *info* is appended to the end of the function call, that function
is a wrapper around a Vulkan CreateInfo structure. The only *dlu_set* functions that are not wrappers around Vulkan structures are
link:dlu_set_debug_message.html[dlu_set_debug_message(3)] and link:dlu_set_device_debug_ext.html[dlu_set_device_debug_ext(3)].
