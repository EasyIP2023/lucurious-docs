== dlu_create_queue_families(3)

== BRIEF DESCRIPTION

*dlu_create_queue_families* - a wrapper function that finds the queue family index of a given queue if it is supported on a particular physical device.

== C SPECIFICATION

[source,c]
----
#define LUCUR_VKCOMP_API
#include <dluc/lucurious.h>

VkBool32 dlu_create_queue_families(
  vkcomp *app,
  uint32_t cur_pd,
  VkQueueFlagBits vkqfbits
);
----

== PARAMETERS

* *app*: A pointer to the link:vkcomp.html[vkcomp(3)] structure.
* *cur_pd*: Current physical device. Selects which elements in the (*struct _pd_data*) array to do operations with. link:vkcomp.html[vkcomp(3)]   
* *vkqfbits*: A link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkQueueFlagBits.html[VkQueueFlagBits] enum that when
utilized in *dlu_create_queue_families* allows for the checking and setting of queue families indices. One can do bit wise or operations with VkQueueFlagBits to select
mulitple queues. 

== DESCRIPTION

Almost every operation in Vulkan, from submitting command buffers to presenting images to a surface, requires commands to be submitted to a hardware queue. The
*dlu_create_queue_families(3)* creates queue family indices used during link:dlu_create_logical_device.html[dlu_create_logical_device(3)]. These queues are created when
a given VkDevice is created.

== RETURN VALUES

Returns VK_TRUE upon failure.
 
== BUGS

N/A.
