== dlu_create_vk_buffer(3)

== BRIEF DESCRIPTION

*dlu_create_vk_buffer* - a wrapper that creates VkBuffer and VkDeviceMemory objects which allows for the mapping of data that the shader can read.

== C SPECIFICATION

[source,c]
----
#define LUCUR_VKCOMP_API
#include <dluc/lucurious.h>

VkResult dlu_create_vk_buffer(
  vkcomp *app,
  uint32_t cur_ld,
  uint32_t cur_bd,
  VkDeviceSize size,
  VkBufferCreateFlagBits flags,
  VkBufferUsageFlags usage,

== PARAMETERS

* *app*: A pointer to the link:vkcomp.html[vkcomp(3)] structure.
* *cur_ld*: Current logical device. Selects which element in the (*struct _ld_data*) array to do operations with (link:vkcomp.html[vkcomp(3)]). This informations needs to be passed in order
to associate a logical device with a VkBuffer and VkDeviceMemory.
* *cur_bd*: Current buffer data. Selects which element in the (*struct _bd_data*) array to create VkBuffer and VkDeviceMemory objects (link:vkcomp.html[vkcomp(3)]).    
* *size*: A member of the link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkBufferCreateInfo.html[VkBufferCreateInfo] structure and is used to determine the size
of a given VkBuffer. The VkDeviceMemory will either be the same size or larger depending on the queried memory properties size.
* *flags*: A member of the link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkBufferCreateFlagBits.html[VkBufferCreateFlag] enum used to determine any extra functionality
one might do on a given VkBuffer.
* *usage*: A member of the link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkBufferUsageFlagBits.html[VkBufferUsageFlag] enum used to set what a given VkBuffer
is capable of.
* *sharingMode*: A member of the link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkSharingMode.html[VkSharingMode] enum used to pass how a VkBuffer is shared
when accessed by multiple queue families.
* *queueFamilyIndexCount*: A member of the link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkBufferCreateInfo.html[VkBufferCreateInfo] structure used to pass
the the number of queue families this buffer can use. Only matters if *VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT* is enabled.
* *pQueueFamilyIndices*: A member of the link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkBufferCreateInfo.html[VkBufferCreateInfo] structure used to pass
the actual queue family indices that a given VkBuffer can access. Only matters if *VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT* is enabled.
* *requirements_mask*: A member of the link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkMemoryPropertyFlagBits.html[VkMemoryPropertyFlag] enum used to determine where
a given VkBuffer and VkDeviceMemory resides in memory (VRAM, RAM, etc...).

The *dlu_create_vk_buffer(3)* function creates a VkBuffer object that is backed by a VkDeviceMemory object. This function queries a VkPhysicalDevice to check to see
if the chosen *requirements_mask* is a good fit for the VkBuffer/VkDeviceMemory. This function also binds the entire VkDeviceMemory object to the entire VkBuffer object regardless
of the size of a given VkBuffer. One can then use link:dlu_vk_map_mem.html[dlu_vk_map_mem(3)] which uses memcpy(3) to directly map data into the VkDeviceMemory object.
Depending upon the set *requirements_mask* values, link:dlu_vk_map_mem.html[dlu_vk_map_mem(3)] allowed usage may vary. One can check [Vulkan GPU Info](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org)
for different memory configurations.

== RETURN VALUES

Upon success or failure function returns one of Vulkans link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkResult.html[VkResult]
enum constants. These result codes are used to indicate return status information and runtime errors.

== BUGS

N/A.
