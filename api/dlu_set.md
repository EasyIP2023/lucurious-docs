## BRIEF DESCRIPTION

Most **dlu_set**_* functions are just wrappers around vulkan structures. Thus, can be ignored and not utilized.
I added them to limit the amount of lines of C code one has to write. Whenever the keyword **info** is appended
to the end of the function call, that function is a wrapper around a Vulkan CreateInfo Structure.
