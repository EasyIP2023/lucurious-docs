I initially started thinking of how I wanted to implement lucurious as of February of 2019. I was watching the t.v series The Expanse and was looking at how 
cool all of those user interfaces looked. I was like wow I've seen this done before in video games and in web browsers why not as an entire compositor. 
After over a year of on/off programming and thinking it is now an **easy to use** library for building highly sophisticated and advanced Vulkan DRM renderers 
that work directly with KMS. These renderers allow for easy creation of interactable single application compositors that appear to be straight out of science fiction.
