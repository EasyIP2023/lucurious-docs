This is not official documentation. I initially started thinking of how I wanted to implement lucurious as of February 2019. I was watching the t.v series 
The Expanse and was looking at how awesome the user interfaces looked. After thinking I realized that I've seen this done before in video games and in web browsers. 
So, why not as an entire compositor? After over a year of on/off programming and thinking it is now an **easy to use** library for building highly sophisticated and 
advanced Vulkan DRM renderers. These renderers allow for easy creation of interactable single application compositors that appear to be straight out of science fiction.
