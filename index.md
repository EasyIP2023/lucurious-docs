These documents are not official in any way, form, or capacity. I initially starting thinking of how I wanted to implement February of 2019. 
I was watching the t.v series The Expanse and was looking at how cool all of those user interfaces looked. I was like wow I've seen this done before 
in video games and in web browsers why not as an entire compositor. After over a year of programming and thinking it is now an **easy to use** library 
for building highly sophisticated and advanced Vulkan DRM renderers that work directly with KMS. These renderers allow for easy creation of interactable 
single application compositors that appear to be straight out of science fiction.
