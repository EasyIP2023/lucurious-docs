=head1 NAME

cdspeed -  decrease  the speed of you cdrom to get faster access time

=head1 SYNOPSIS

cdspeed [-h] [-d device] -s speed

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Modern cdrom drives are too fast. It can take several seconds  on a  60x
speed cdrom drive to spin it up and read data from the drive.  The result
is that these drives  are just  a lot slower than a 8x or 24x drive.
This is especially true if you are only occasionally (e.g every 5 seconds)
reading a small file. This utility limits the speed and makes the  drive
more  responsive  when  accessing  small files.

cdspeed makes the drive also less noisy and is very useful
if you want to listen to music on your computer.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<-h> display a short help text

B<-d> use the given device instead of /dev/cdrom

B<-s> set the speed. The  argument  is a  integer.  Zero
means restore maximum speed.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Set the maximum speed to 8 speed cdrom:

          cdspeed -s 8

Restore maximum speed:

          cdspeed -s 0


=head1 EXIT STATUS

cdspeed returns  a  zero  exist  status  if it succeeds to
change to set the maximum speed of the  cdrom  drive.  Non
